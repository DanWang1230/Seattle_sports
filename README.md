## Results

* From the analysis, we get the years of high win percentage for Seahawks are around 1990 and 2007, with periods of decline following both high points.

* The Marinerâ€™s win percentage shows a continuing increase up to 2003 and stays high from 2003 to 2010.

* The Storm's win percentage reaches a peak at 2010 and keeps increasing in recent years.

* The analysis shows that the win percentage of Sounder FC is relative stable and stays in between 0.554 to 0.657.
